# 2023/11/8 - title and input for calendar

At first, I decided to implement this react application by using three components such as title, dates, show. Title is to show the title only. So, it's simple html component. Dates is to enter the start date and the end date. I want to use date picker library since it's easy to implement it with a nice view. And the last Show section is to show the images from the start date to the end date with css and some functionality such as making a heart(like button), link function etc. I tried to use useContext, createContext, but until now, I failed to make it. So, i decided to make it without deviding as several components. After making it all, i will think about it again.
Today, I just made Title and Dates. From Dates, I can now select the dates(start and end) from the input tags. I had to make tests for it. I will do it tomorrow.
